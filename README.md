Oneup! is an HTML5-based arcade game where the player navigates through increasingly challenging levels, collecting stars and reaching the top of the screen to progress. The game features sliding platforms, falling mines, and a unique double-jump ability that adds depth to the gameplay.

## Gameplay Overview

- **Objective**: Reach the top of the screen in each level while collecting stars and avoiding obstacles.
- **Mechanics**: The player controls the Oneup-character, who has the ability to jump twice. Progress through levels by reaching the top while avoiding mines and falling off the map.
- **Challenges**: As the player advances, new challenges appear, such as sliding platforms and randomly generated level layouts.

## Features

- **Randomized Levels**: Each level is generated using a seed, making platform positions and challenges different every time.
- **Physics Engine**: All game objects are physics-based, creating dynamic interactions between the player, platforms, and mines.
- **Progression**: If the character falls off the map, the game restarts from level 1, adding a high-stakes replayability factor.
